- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards. They may take appropriate corrective action (warnings, temporary/permanent bans) if behaviour violates this Code.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces (repositories, issues, pull requests, documentation) and in public spaces when representing the project or community.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour:
